# Configuration and artifacts

## B4. Configuration

Fill this block at checkpoint 1, write it to `_private/config.json`, and show it back to the operator.

```
SOURCE:            <absolute path, read-only>
RUN_DIR:           <the folder you were started in>
COUNTRIES:         <where the company and its employees are, for example DE, BR, US, IN>
LANGUAGES:         <languages on the drive; detection covers all of them>
ACCOUNT:           <provider and plan, as stated by the operator>
CONTENT_MODE:      metadata-only | masked-excerpts | local-model
NDA_PARTNERS:      <companies the operator has NDAs with; completed at checkpoint 2 from the NDAs you find>
SKIP_FOLDERS:      <folders the operator wants left out without scanning; default none>
QA_SAMPLE:         299 (default) | 149 | 59 | 598
SIGNATORY:         <name and role of the person who signs the attestation>
```

**Manifest columns:** manifest_id, relative_path, parent_id (for members of emails, archives, mailboxes, PDFs), size, mtime, sha256, magic_type, extension, placeholder, pages, ocr_pages, readable (yes or no), rule_hits (rule IDs with page numbers), category, verdict (`copy`, `exclude`, `review`, `skipped`), decided_by (`rule`, `operator`, `default`), reason (rule IDs only, no content), copied_sha256.

**run_report.md** (counts only; no file names, no folder names below the top level, no content):
1. Run: dates, run duration, agent tool and version, account type, CONTENT_MODE, OS, tool versions (tesseract, poppler, qpdf, exiftool, readpst, Python packages).
2. Inventory: files and bytes, by type and by language where detected.
3. Reconciliation: inventory = copied + excluded by rule + excluded by operator + excluded by default (unanswered review) + skipped (junk, online-only). State that the totals match.
4. Exclusions by category code (P1 to P7, N1, N2), file counts each, and containers excluded because of single members.
5. Copied files whose content could not be read, by format (they were decided by name, folder, and metadata).
6. Method: gates, metadata, every page extracted, OCR with orientation, detectors, review list, number of NDA partners (without names).
7. Quality check: sample size, seed, findings, the supported claim from B9, over-exclusion check result.
8. Integrity: copied files verified by SHA-256; source snapshot unchanged.
9. Incidental personal data: copied files contain incidental names (contacts, signatures, metadata authors). They are pseudonymized by The General Data Company under the data processing agreement before any use.
10. Reminders for the responsible person (not legal advice): sign the data processing agreement before sharing; a lawful basis for passing on the incidental personal data (in the EU, Art. 6(1)(f) or a compatibility check under Art. 6(4) GDPR); privacy notices that name data licensees as recipients; whether a data protection impact assessment is needed; in Germany, whether the works council must be involved.

**attestation_draft.md** (filled only from the manifest and QA results):

> On [date], [company] ran an on-premise screening of [N] files ([size]) from [system description]. Records whose primary content is personal data of natural persons, including employee files, HR records, payroll documents, identity documents, applications, health records, and private correspondence, as well as non-disclosure agreements and material received under them, were identified and excluded before delivery. [E] files were excluded and [K] files were copied unchanged. A random sample of [n] copied files was reviewed by [name, role] with [findings] findings. Incidental personal data in business records remains for pseudonymization under the data processing agreement.
